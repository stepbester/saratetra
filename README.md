# Saratetra
A simple JavaScript Tetris clone. I did this in about a week and then left it, so no guarantees.

## Try it out
I'm currently hosting the game on Amazon: [here](https://saratetra.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/saratetra.html).

## Updated to use Browserify
This project has been turned into a Node.js package, and depends on Browserify to build it.
1. Install Browserify globally using `npm install browserify -g`.  
2. Use `npm run build` to invoke Browserify and build `saratetra.js`.
